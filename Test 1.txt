CHANGES MADE:

none, first test

OBSERVATIONS:
-------------
Gen.
13 : not much
14 : starting to show promise
22 : looking stupid again
23 : looking better
26 : most seem to not have simple paths
30 : simple paths again, maybe reset wasn't such a good idea...
42 : most react to stimuli
44 : some react
51 : one shows near intelligence
54 : most react
59 : most react
60 : some react
72 : it's like they have a harder time moving in one direction
85 : meh, stopping

CONCLUSIONS:
------------
The current inputs are are the right track (normalized), but I should probably set the input relative to the "orientation" of the ghost. Turning speed to the left or right should relate to the relative position of the closest pacman. Perhaps change input to the relative angle?

POTENTIAL FUTURE CHANGES:
-------------------------
1. Reduce to single input, relative angle
