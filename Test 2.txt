TEST 2

DATE:
-----
3/8/2015 ~7pm

CHANGES MADE:
-------------
1. One input, relative angle

OBSERVATIONS:
-------------
Gen.
1  : Some show promise, obviously responding to stimuli
4  : Half the population seem to negatively respond to stimuli
5  : Four remained on the screen, they had simple motion
7  : They all left the screen, but some returned. They turn slowly
10 : Most seem to be a lot better
15 : They are pretty good. All are actively seeking the closest pacman

Slows down after a while

CONCLUSIONS:
------------
Realizing that the input and output needs to make sense in each other's context really helped.
When determining the input/output, make sure they are similar. (Don't input [x2-x1, y2-x1] and output omega)
Slowing could be a potential memory leak

POTENTIAL FUTURE CHANGES:
-------------------------
1. More neurons to see how smart they can get
2. Introduce a fresh ghost every generation to help with diversity
3. Alter code such that instead of calculating a normalized difference, just find the literal difference
4. Resolve memory leak
